                <p>While the Myanmar conflict has little to no media coverage in the West, there are many countries and 
                figures involved in pertuating violence or seeking to end it</p>
                <p><strong>Min Aung Hlaing</strong></p>    
                <p>Myanmar’s ruthless dictator doubling as leader of the Myanmar military that took 
                over the government in 2021. Ordering the killings of anyone who defies him is commonplace, even 
                those who work under him.</p>
                <p><strong>Aung San Suu Kyi</strong></p>    
                <p>Current unofficial leader of the NLD, fighting for democracy ever since 1988, when she became 
                secretary of the party at its birth, and eventually becoming a prominent political figure, heading 
                the party election after election. She was put under house arrest after the 2021 coup.</p>
                <p><strong>Myanmar Ethnic Groups</strong></p>    
                <p>The Burmese government officially recognizes 135 distinct ethnic groups, split up into seven states: 
                Kachin, Kayah, Karen, Chin, Mon, Rakhine and Shan. The only group without a state is the Burman. Each 
                ethnic group has taken sides on the conflict, with most fighting against the military, but some opting 
                to fight for the military, like some groups in the Karen state. A handful of ethnic groups are even 
                fighting against each other.</p>
                <p><strong>Rohingya</strong></p>    
                <p>A Muslim ethnic group in the Rakhine state, the Rohingya have been heavily discriminated against 
                for the past several decades ever since a 1982 citizenship law was passed, denying the group of citizenship 
                and promoting violence against them. Today, the Rohingya are considered the largest stateless ethnic 
                group in the world, and are currently forced to stay within camps. With 700,000 Rohingya fleeing to 
                Bangladesh, the military has taken violent action against the people, killing thousands in retaliation.</p>
                <p><strong>NLD</strong></p>    
                <p>The National League for Democracy is exactly what it sounds like–leaders and supporters of the NLD 
                have been fighting for democracy as early as 1988, with Aung San Suu Kyi leading the party since its 
                birth to incredible success. The party has won every election it was a part of, yet the military’s 
                reluctance to hand over power has led to constitutional changes or coups in order to maintain some 
                authority in the country.</p>
                <p><strong>NUG</strong></p>    
                <p>The National Unity Government of Myanmar was created in 2021 by the exiled members of the NLD. 
                The party gained the country-wide favor of the general population and continues to work towards 
                democracy by overseeing their military, the People’s Defense Force, and gaining international 
                recognition..</p>
                <p><strong>Bangladesh, India, Thailand, and Malaysia</strong></p>    
                <p>The four major countries taking in the most Burmese refugees, with Bangladesh allowing for 
                around 1.1 million refugees to flee into their borders</p>
                <p><strong>ASEAN</strong></p>    
                <p>The Association of Southeast Asian Nations was formed during the Vietnam War, and includes 
                Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and 
                Vietnam. Some countries, like Singapore, and Vietnam, have been accused of supplying oil for 
                the junta and providing the military with communication technology respectively. </p>
                <p><strong>UN</strong></p>    
                <p>The United Nations, comprised of 194 different countries throughout the world, has 
                remained unusually silent in the wake of the coup. With their only major response being a 
                handful of public statements, little humanitarian aid has been delivered. Instead, they opt 
                to leave ASEAN at the head of critical Myanmar operations.</p>
