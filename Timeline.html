                                as the Burma Independence Army, before switching sides to the British as the 
                                Burma National Army. In gaining favor of the British, a successful negotiation 
                                resulted in a new constitution on January 4, 1948. After being under British 
                                rule for the past 124 years (1824-1948), Burma was its own independent nation.</p>

                            his military took over Rangoon, the former capital. He justified his actions by pointing out the 
                            current economic distress and lack of ethnic minority autonomy. The bloodless coup was swift, 
                            lasting only 2 hours, as Ne Win established a socialist government that suppressed any form of 
                            dissent, eliminating the previous democracy. This would remain true for the next 26 years</p>

                            <p class="card-info">Burma, now Myanmar, held its first general election since Ne Win’s Coup. 
                            The junta military would face the National League for Democracy (NLD), a party that was led 
                            by Aung San Suu Kyi and held the support of the citizens and ethnic minorities. As expected, 
                            the NLD won in a landslide, having 80% of their people filling seats in the People’s Assembly. 
                            The military refused to accept the results and continued to hold power for the next two decades, 
                            claiming that the country would be on the path to democracy in that time.</p>

                            initial win. Again, a landslide victory with NLD members filling parliament seats was enough to form a 
                            government. By the 2008 constitution, Aung San Suu Kyi was not to rule as Prime Minister, yet she assumed 
                            the new, similar position of State Counsellor. Still, the military still controlled several aspects of the 
                            governments, such as security.</p>

                            how individuals are treated to this day. In 2018, the United Nations accused Myanmar of ethnic 
                            genocide, after Rohingya militants attacked a guard post, resulting in government military 
                            retaliation that killed 6700 Rohingya and diplaced 700,000 more</p>

                            the past three elections resulted in guaranteed NLD wins, the military saw 
                            this as a threat and would take action the following year.</p>

                            resorted to force. In an early morning in February, the military overthrew the government 
                            and took Aung San Suu Kyi under house arrest, while the rest of the parliament members were
                            sent into hiding. Afterwards, a series of protests in the capital, Naypyidaw, condemning the 
                            coup were met with violence with 600 killed, many tortured, and plenty of villages burned. 
                            This would instigate a civil war between civilian armed forces and the junta</p>

The civilian side appears to have a slight edge over the junta as the opposing military loses soldiers by the day. However, innocent civilians, families, and the Rohingya are still are constant risk of starvation, displacement and death as the conflict rages on with next to no widespread international attention.
                                <br>
                            A recent 7.7 magnitude earthquake in March 2025 has only worsened circumstances, decimating generators and power lines that left the people in the dark. Without help or media attention, Myanmar could fall into another decades-long regime of violent and relentless oppression.
                                <br>
                            Geopolitics often make it difficult to intervene, but using our power as a society, we can bring attention to these destructive, modern-day atrocities. One day, international pressure could potentially bring about the end to the violence.</p>
