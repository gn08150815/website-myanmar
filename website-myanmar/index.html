        <div id="home-container1">
            <div  class="home-text-L">
                <p>In 2021, Myanmar’s military junta launched a successful coup against the newly elected government, 
                the NLD (National League for Democracy) in order to take power in Myanmar. A civilian protest took place 
                in the country’s capital, Naypyidaw, with protesters demanding the reestablishment of stolen democracy. 
                Their cries were met with violence, as the military proceeded to kill 600 protesters. In retaliation, the 
                pro-democracy citizens began to mobilize for war, forming the National Unity Government with pre-coup leaders 
                and their military, the People’s Defense Force. </p>

                <p>Despite this development, in the center of the conflict is 3.6 million displaced victims and families, forced 
                to flee from their homes when conflict became too dangerous to stay. Including in that figure is an ethnic minority 
                group, the Rohingya, who are undergoing ethnic genocide. Violence strengthened by a 1982 citizenship law that excluded 
                citizen rights from the group, the Rohingya the largest stateless ethnic minority in the world. A recent 2017 
                military crackdown killing 6700 victims worsened their situation, and the 2021 installation of the very same military 
                that sought their execution ensured risks of total genocide. Millions have already fled to countries like Bangladesh and Malaysia.</p>
                <p>
                As it stands, there appears to be no end in sight, and as endless fighting continues, so will the relentless death toll.</p>
